need a new routine to give orbital elements for two resolved bodies
Maybe make it general to work on 2 point masses or 1 point mass and 1 resolved
or 2 resolveds
compute_semi in spring.c
Done: it is called orbels_twobodies()

modify dodrift_bin so that can drift either 2 point masses, 1 point mass
1 resolved or 2 resolveds

I wrote a new routine  dodrift_twores which will drift both resolved bodies
